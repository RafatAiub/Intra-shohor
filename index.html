            <div class="bg-style">
                JavaScript can be a client-side scripting language and one of the first viable, commonly utilized
                scripting language. The term client-side scripting language infers that it runs at the client-side(or on
                the client machine) interior the web-browsers, but one imperative thing to be sure is that client's
                web-browser besides must support the JavaScript or it must be JavaScript engaged. These days, most of
                the cutting edge web browsers bolster JavaScript and have their JavaScript engines. Google
                Chrome has its claim JavaScript motor called V8. It totally depends on the web-developers how they
                utilize JavaScript and for what, since it can be utilized for some things in web change. One of the
                pre-eminent common businesses of JavaScript is to endorse data given by the client inside the shape

            <h3 style="color: white;">What does javascript event loop do???</h3>
            <div class="bg-style">
                Before explain this functionality of event loop, let's try to know about javascript. We know javascript
                is a single threaded scripting language. That's means that it execute the entire code line by line. To
                do this it use one stack as task holder and a task queue. But when set time out function or other
                functions which are dependable on web APIs come into this picture then some things happened diffenent.
                When instruction are execute one by one and between these a setTimeout function also called then the
                callback function go to web api and set the time as a timer. So before finishing that time the other
                task go to the stack and execution are syncronusly execute. After, when the time out then the call back
                function go to the task queue and wait for the loop called 'loop event' to call asyncronously the
                callBack() to the stack and perform the execution of that function. Actually to further perform an event
                browser use this method.

            <div class="bg-style">
                At the storage point of view the capacity of local storage is 5MB to 10MB but for session storage it is
                only 5MB. The clint can read only local storage. In both sorage there is no transfer of data to the
                server.In session storage is fully dependable on session and works per window or tab. that's why data is
                stored only for the duration of a session. On the other hand in case of lacal storage data are stored
                permanently. Clint can delete manually or by doing code.
